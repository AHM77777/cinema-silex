1.- For some reason, after adding two .htaccess files to my silex folders (one on the base folder and other inside 'web'), it worked, though the routes were not resolving properly.

2.- I tweaked around the program a little more and the routes worked with just an .htaccess file on the web folder. This left me with the problem of cutting the path to 'localhost' only.

3.- To trim the path I prepare a VirtualHost that pointed to my project web folder, and added a Redirect directive on the .htaccess file. This allowed me to use localhost as the base path for accessing my site.
The virtual host was prepared on /xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf, it has the following config:
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName cinema-silex
        DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/cinema-silex/web"
        SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV "development"
        <Directory "C:/xampp/htdocs/cinema-silex/web">
            DirectoryIndex index.php
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            Allow from all
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>
The line added to my .htaccess was the following: RedirectMatch permanent ^/app\.php/(.*) /$1
